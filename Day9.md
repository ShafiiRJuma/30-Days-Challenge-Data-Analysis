**Day:** 9

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Power BI  
**Challenge:** PwC Virtual Internship PhoneNow Retention Management Dashboard

Today i created this dashboard from PwC Virtual Internship task 3 which involved finding key issues causing customers of the PhoneNow to churn out, form this the task involved analyzing the given dataset to find relationship between customers who churn out with available services, prices, Tickets raised, and other factors. In the end after careful analysis i deduce three factors indicators of customers to churn out. There were more customers churning out from those subscribed in month-on-month services than those in longer term, more customers churn out whose tenure is of one month, and more customers churn whose internet service is fiber optic. I created a dashboard to visualize this and here is my power BI dashboard.
