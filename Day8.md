### Background
Today is my first day in my entire life to open Power BI, not once in my life even by chance i opened Power BI, But for the journey and road to become Data Analyst i opened today and started working with it.

### Thought Process
Despite the fact is was guided to present to create a dashboard that shows KPIs to help Claire visualize Key Mnetrics. This is how i thought on what to includ eon my dashboard.
1. Total Number of Calls Answered and Abandoned: Here to give a summary of how the call center performs by comparing the answered calls and abandoned calls so that they can work on if abondened call number is beyond their (threshold)
2. Speed of Answering Calls: Now while i included numbre of answered calls, it's necessary to know how quick the call center team is in picking up the calls. So i added a card that shows average response time in seconds.
3. Agent Perfomance: Here I added a slicer that shows each Agent's perfomance (Number of calls he/she answered, abandoned, speed of response, and overall trend of his/her performance then Customer Satisfaction. This gives Claire an overview of how each agent perform their tasks.
4. Customer Satisfaction: On the scale of 1-5 each answered call customer rate on the level of satisfaction they receieved, now this gives a clear picture whether the answered calls were really answering client's problems or otherwise and how to improve customer satisfaction.
5. Trend of ANswered calls and abandoned on a monthly basis.

From this here is my dashboard that i created and submitted for review.
### Learning Outcome
Power BI seems to be a great analysis and visualization tool in deed and i can't wait to keep working and making insightful and helpful analysis of data through this Tool.
