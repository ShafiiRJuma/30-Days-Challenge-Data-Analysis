**Challenge Overview:**  
Today i wanted to challenge myself to create a simple dashboard using Spotify Most Streamed Songs 2023 dataset. i'm saying simple because this is my first time creating a dashboard and i really did it slowly and steady following this video on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTlQvyNQ3PM). With the experience i got today i want to dedicate my remaining five days in excel practice more on creating dashaboards to perfect my skills and bring out aesthetic excel dashaboard before i move into Power BI tool.
The dashboard i created contained Top 10 Streamed Artist and Top 10 Streamed Songs only those two items and here is the look from the data to the Dashboard itslef.

**How I created this Dashboard**
To create a dashaboard in Microsoft Excel you kind have a knowledge working with PivotTables as through that you just copy and paste the PivotChat into your dahsboard and optimize it to have that aesthetic look.

**Step 01**
After opening my dataset i verified that my data was clean and had no issues, after that i converted my dataset into a table for easier sorting and formatting, quick calculations like sums, average and counts.

**Step 02**
After converting my dataset into a table then i created a pivot table and started a new workbook for my pivot table.

**Step 03**
On my pivot table workbook i filtered only data that involved *Top 10 Most streamed Songs* by checking Track Name and Streams then filter only to show top 10

**Step 04**
Choice of the Chart, this usually depends with the data available but definetly acocrding to the data that i want to show top 10 streamed songs Bar Charts is the right choice for this type. To add a chart i clicked on my pivot table -> then clicked Pivot Table Analyze -> then Pivot Table where i was presented with number of choices to choose from and selected Bar Chart.

**Step 05**
After creating a Bar Chart of my liking and having it reflecting top 10 streamed songs i copied the chart and pasted it on my new workbook whihc i labeled Dahsboard. Then repeated the same process for the Top Streamed Artists on Spotify.

**Learning Outcome:**
