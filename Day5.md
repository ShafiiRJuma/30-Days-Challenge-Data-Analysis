**Challenge Overview:**  
Today i wanted to challenge myself to create a simple dashboard using Spotify Most Streamed Songs 2023 dataset. i'm saying simple because this is my first time creating a dashboard and i really did it slowly and steady following this video on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTlQvyNQ3PM). With the experience i got today i want to dedicate my remaining five days in excel practice more on creating dashaboards to perfect my skills and bring out aesthetic excel dashaboard before i move into Power BI tool.

**How I created this Dashboard**
To create a dashaboard in Microsoft Excel you kind have a knowledge working with PivotTables as through that you just copy and paste the PivotChat into your dahsboard and optimize it to have that aesthetic look.
**Step 01**
After opening my dataset i verified that my data was clean and had no issues, after that i converted my dataset into a table for easier sorting and formatting, quick calculations like sums, average and counts.

**Step 02**
After converting my dataset into a table then i created a pivot table and started a new workbook for my pivot table.
**Learning Outcome:**
