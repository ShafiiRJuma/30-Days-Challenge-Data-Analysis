**Challenge Overview:**  
There is so much to learn on Microsoft Excel and i only have 6 Days to go finishing everything on Excel, today i took a challenge on Exploratory Data Analysis using Pivot Table which is one of the powerful skills to have as the Data Analyst. I used a dataset i obtained while taking a short course on [Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis](https://careerfoundry.com/en/tutorials/data-analytics-for-beginners/descriptive-statistics-and-exploratory-data-analysis) on careerfoundry website. This dataset contains information about Bike rental in New York City. There is so much useful business insights can be obtained from this dataset but here were my curious questins i wanted to uderstand from the dataset.

**What Day sees the most bike rental?:** It's necessary to understand Days that have high volume of bike rental in business as it will directly inform the company how to locate resources on those peak days including staffing, maintainance but also Marketing to target those days. Another angle is to see how to improve bike rentals on days that see less volume by various methods such discounts.
To do this i utilized Pivot Table to create a table with two columns Days and Daily Bike Rental (Counting number of bikes rented in a particular day)
Here is the graph that shows the result.
