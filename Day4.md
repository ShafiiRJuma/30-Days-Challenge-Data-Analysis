**Challenge Overview:**  
There is so much to learn on Microsoft Excel and i only have 6 Days to go finishing everything on Excel, today i took a challenge on Exploratory Data Analysis using Pivot Table which is one of the powerful skills to have as the Data Analyst. I used a dataset i obtained while taking a short course on [Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis](https://careerfoundry.com/en/tutorials/data-analytics-for-beginners/descriptive-statistics-and-exploratory-data-analysis) on careerfoundry website. This dataset contains information about Bike rental in New York City. There is so much useful business insights can be obtained from this dataset but here were my curious questins i wanted to uderstand from the dataset.

**What Day sees the most bike rental?:** It's necessary to understand Days that have high volume of bike rental in business as it will directly inform the company how to locate resources on those peak days including staffing, maintainance but also Marketing to target those days. Another angle is to see how to improve bike rentals on days that see less volume by various methods such discounts.
To do this i utilized Pivot Table to create a table with two columns Days and Daily Bike Rental (Counting number of bikes rented in a particular day)
Here is the graph that shows the result.

**Findings from the Analysis:**

- **Rental Growth Over Months**: The data shows a consistent rise in bike rentals through January, February, and March, which are peak months. Recognizing this trend enables the company to prepare for high demand early in the year, potentially adjusting inventory and staffing accordingly.

- **Top Station - Grove St Path**: Grove St Path station in New York City stands out with the highest number of rentals, making it a critical location for meeting demand. By prioritizing bike availability and maintenance here, the company can ensure a seamless experience for frequent renters in this area.

- **Impact of Temperature on Rentals**: Rentals peaked at specific temperatures, especially around 14°C and 16°C, suggesting that people prefer to rent bikes in mild weather. With this insight, the company could run weather-targeted promotions on days with favorable temperatures to boost engagement and rentals.

- **Most Active Age Group**: The 35-44 age group was the most frequent renter, revealing a primary customer demographic. Creating targeted offers or loyalty incentives for this age range could improve retention and increase overall satisfaction.

- **Weekly Patterns in Bike Rentals**: Rentals were highest on Wednesdays and Thursdays, with a noticeable drop on weekends. This mid-week peak points to a commuter-driven pattern. Weekend promotions could help balance demand, while commuter perks or discounts during weekdays could further appeal to regular users.

These insights provide a clear direction for aligning business strategies with user trends, helping the company make well-informed decisions to maximize growth and customer satisfaction.


**Learning Outcome:**  

Today's challenge deepened my understanding of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** through the use of **Pivot Tables** in Excel, enabling a detailed exploration of the dataset. Key takeaways include:

- **Pivot Table Mastery**: I learned how to effectively use Pivot Tables to summarize, sort, and analyze data quickly. This tool allowed me to identify trends and insights without complex formulas, enhancing my ability to uncover key patterns.

- **Data-Driven Insights**: By structuring the data through EDA, I could identify factors impacting bike rentals, such as temperature, age group, location, and day of the week. This process showed me how EDA serves as the foundation for actionable business insights.

- **Identifying Patterns and Trends**: I learned the importance of looking at data from multiple perspectives to spot underlying trends. This approach to data analysis highlighted valuable insights for potential strategic actions in real business contexts.

This day’s practice in EDA using Pivot Tables has provided me with essential skills for interpreting data, recognizing patterns, and turning insights into meaningful recommendations for business impact.
