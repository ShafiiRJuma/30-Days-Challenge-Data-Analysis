**Tools:** Microsoft Excel Pivot Table

**Challenge Overview:**  
After learning how to perform Data Cleaning using Microsoft Excel from removing duplicates, blank rows, to creating consistent formatting from the
previous days today i embarked on a journey to practice Pivot Table which is another tool within Microsoft Excel can help us to summarize the data
we have and get a snapshot of what the data is all about and get answers to some of our questions from the data.

**Description of the dataset**
This dataset presents the age-adjusted death rates for the 10 leading causes of death in the United States beginning in 1999. This dataset from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-leading-causes-of-death-united-states) gives us the top leading causes with number of death recorded per disease from that year. As a curious person i was interested to know What are the leading causes of death in the United States? What are the leading causes of death per state? and what is the trend of death in the United States from 1999? i picked this data due to those questions in my head.


**Challenge Steps:**
I downloaded the data in excel and opened it using Microsoft Excel and started to explore it to get an understanding of the data, analyze columns to understand datatypes, number of columns, total rows, and overall look of the data.
